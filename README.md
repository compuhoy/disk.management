Disk Management is a Microsoft Windows utility first introduced in Windows XP as a replacement for the fdisk command. It enables users to view and manage the disk drives installed in their computer and the partitions associated with those drives. As the image below shows, each drive is displayed followed by the layout, type, file system, status, capacity, free space, % free, and fault tolerance.

## How to Open Disk Management in Windows ?

* Open Control Panel.
* Select System and Security.
* Select Administrative Tools. It's located near the bottom of the window, so you might need to scroll down to see it.
* In the Administrative Tools window that's now open, double-tap or double-click Computer Management.
* Choose Disk Management on the left side of the window. It's located under Storage.
